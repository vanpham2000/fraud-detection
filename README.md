# fraud-detection

This is a fraud detection using machine learning technique 

Here I am using Neural Network for Binary Classification to classify the data set for fraud

I also create an api to make the model accessible for prediction, transforming it into a service that can take JSON inputs and return predictions. This enables the model to be deployed and accessed by other applications for real-time or batch predictions.

just download the file down

install libray:
```
pandas 
pytorch 
Scikit-Learn
Flask
Pickle
```
